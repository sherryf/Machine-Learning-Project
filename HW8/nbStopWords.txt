Investigate various settings for Nâ€”what values seem to improve the classifier?
N = 10 -> Accuracy: 0.8056
N = 20 -> Accuracy: 0.8056
N = 30 -> Accuracy: 0.8333
N = 40 -> Accuracy: 0.8611
N = 50 -> Accuracy: 0.8611
N = 60 -> Accuracy: 0.8333

N = 45 -> Accuracy: 0.8611
N = 41 -> Accuracy: 0.8611

N = 55 -> Accuracy: 0.8333
N = 54 -> Accuracy: 0.8611

From the several experiments above, we can see that when N = 40, the accuracy increases and if N above 55, the accuracy decrease.
