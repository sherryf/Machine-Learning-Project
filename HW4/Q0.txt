Do you think a decision tree will work for the politician dataset? What about for the education dataset?
Yes. I think decision tree will work for the politician dataset. First, the attributes of the politician dataset are small. Also, for every attribute, there are only two possible outputs: no or yes. Finally, the politician result only contains binary outputs: democrat or republican. Using decision tree will make the machine learning process more efficient and use the data more sufficiently.
And for the education dataset, the reason is similar with the politician dataset. The number of attributes is small. All the attributes M1 to M5, P1 to P4 and F have binary outputs: A or notA. The finally result for the student grade has binary outputs.
Generally, decision tree work well when instances of the dataset can be described by attribute-value pairs. And the target function is discrete valued. During the prediction, disjunctive hypothesis may be required. Also, the training data will have some possible noisy training data.
